# TreePostTopper
The best part of 3D printing is when you can make a one-off print to fix something that you might have to otherwise throw away.

# Wahoo Tickr Batter Cover
I created this model because when I tried to replace the battery in my Wahoo Tickr the cover's pins deformed and snapped. It would no longer seal with only two pins available so I designed this replacement cover for myself. I went through 5 test prints to get a good fit and I'm pleased with it.
